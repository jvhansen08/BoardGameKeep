## Project Proposal: Boardgamer's Paradise

1. General Overview

    The idea of this application is to provide a way for board game owners to keep track of their board games - a sort of library for board games. Additionally, users will be able to view/sort their games based on parameters such as number of players, duration, etc. It will also allow users to view board game stores near them

2. Technical Challenges

    None of us has ever integrated firebase within a web application. Even more, we haven't depended on firebase as a backend, so we will need to learn how to use it as such. We will need to learn how to use the geolocation API, along with some API that will display stores near a user's location.

3. Requirements

    a. 
    * Firebase Auth
    * Firebase File Storage
    * Firebase Firestore

    b. 
    * Firebase as a Backend + hosting website on github pages

    c. 
    * Use Geolocation API

4. Time Estimation
    *
